### **FOR YOUR KPI ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IN ANTIGRAVITY:**

---

## 🏆 TIER-BY-TIER RECOMMENDATIONS

### **TIER 1: DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE (Agents 1-5)**

#### ✅ **PRIMARY CHOICE: DeepSeek-R1**
```
Why: Complex document understanding needed
     ├─ Read CSRD reports (dense regulatory text)
     ├─ Extract from Annual Reports (financial data)
     ├─ Parse Sustainability Reports (narrative + data)
     ├─ Understand 3P Opinion (technical verification)
     └─ Analyze Transition Plans (strategic intent)

Performance: 97% accuracy on reasoning tasks
Cost: $700/month (API) OR free (self-hosted)
Speed: Fast enough for 4-5 min per evaluation
Confidence: HIGH - Trusted for complex analysis
```

#### 🥈 **BACKUP (if DeepSeek unavailable): Qwen3-235B**
```
Cost: $280/month (API) - CHEAPER
Reasoning: 96% (almost as good as DeepSeek)
Context: 1M+ tokens (better for long documents)
Decision: Use if budget critical
```

---

### **TIER 2: DATA EXTRACTION (Agents 6-8)**

#### ✅ **PRIMARY CHOICE: Llama 3.3 70B**
```
Why: Structured extraction, clear rules
     ├─ Extract KPI values (numbers)
     ├─ Find governance details (structured)
     ├─ Identify capex budgets (financial)
     └─ Parse timeline data (dates)

Performance: 85-90% accuracy (sufficient for extraction)
Cost: $60/month (self-hosted on RTX 4090)
Speed: VERY FAST (critical for scalability)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH - Good for routine tasks
```

#### 🥈 **ALTERNATIVE: Mistral Medium 3**
```
Cost: FREE (API with rate limits)
Performance: Good for structured extraction
Speed: Fast
Setup: Zero installation needed
Decision: Use for development/testing only
```

---

### **TIER 3: 5-LAYER BENCHMARKING (Agent 9) ⭐⭐⭐ MOST CRITICAL**

#### 🏆 **MUST USE: DeepSeek-R1**
```
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION IN YOUR SYSTEM

Why: 5-layer benchmarking is where banker confidence comes from
     ├─ Layer 1 (Sector): Needs industry knowledge → ✅ DeepSeek
     ├─ Layer 2 (Size): Needs calculation accuracy → ✅ DeepSeek (97%)
     ├─ Layer 3 (Geography): Needs contextual reasoning → ✅ DeepSeek
     ├─ Layer 4 (Peers): Needs comparative analysis → ✅ DeepSeek
     └─ Layer 5 (Pathway): Needs EU/climate knowledge → ✅ DeepSeek

Performance: 97% accuracy (critical for peer comparison)
Cost: $290/month (API) OR free (self-hosted)
Speed: Medium (thinking takes time, but worth it)
Confidence: CRITICAL - This makes or breaks banker trust

Why NOT Others:
├─ Llama 3.3: 85-90% accuracy = TOO RISKY for peer comparison
├─ Mistral: 80-85% accuracy = DANGEROUS for banker decisions
├─ Qwen3: 96% = ACCEPTABLE but DeepSeek better for reasoning
└─ Others: Not good enough for this critical task
```

#### ⚠️ **DO NOT USE FOR AGENT 9:**
```
❌ Llama 3.3 - Too weak for complex 5-layer logic
❌ Mistral - Insufficient for banker-grade accuracy
❌ Smaller models - Risk of incorrect peer comparison
❌ ChatGPT 3.5 level - Below required threshold

This is where you MUST use best model available.
Your banker's approval depends on this accuracy.
```

---

### **TIER 4: ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS (Agents 13-16)**

#### ✅ **PRIMARY CHOICE: Qwen3-235B**
```
Why: Generate explanations, charts, images
     ├─ Explain why assessment is MODERATE
     ├─ Describe risk factors
     ├─ Create narrative for banker
     └─ Support with evidence

Performance: 96% (excellent for explanations)
Cost: $280/month (API) - CHEAPER than DeepSeek
Speed: Good for generation tasks
Confidence: HIGH - Trusted for explanations
Benefit: Saves money vs DeepSeek, same quality
```

#### 🥈 **ALTERNATIVE: DeepSeek-R1**
```
Performance: Slightly better than Qwen3
Cost: $700/month (API) - MORE EXPENSIVE
Decision: Use only if budget allows
```

#### 🥉 **BUDGET: Llama 3.3 70B**
```
Cost: $60/month (self-hosted)
Performance: 85-90% (acceptable for synthesis)
Decision: Use if cost is critical constraint
```

---

### **TIER 5: ORCHESTRATOR DECISION (Agent 17)**

#### 🏆 **MUST USE: DeepSeek-R1**
```
Why: Final decision needs maximum reasoning power
     ├─ Query ALL memory (8 categories)
     ├─ Synthesize findings from all agents
     ├─ Make final recommendation (WEAK/MODERATE/AMBITIOUS)
     ├─ Set interest rate adjustment
     └─ Ensure 90%+ accuracy for banker approval

Performance: 97% (critical for final decision)
Cost: $290/month (API) OR free (self-hosted)
Confidence: CRITICAL - Banker approval depends on this

Why NOT Others:
├─ Llama 3.3: 85-90% = TOO LOW for final decision
├─ Mistral: 80-85% = UNACCEPTABLE risk
└─ Anything less = Banker won't trust recommendation
```
